I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life	5
This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.	2
The editing is a mess, and the transitions of the plot or characters are rather strange. There is no narrative focus and the storytelling is unbalanced. I cannot really understand why such a bad movie received an overwhelming approval from the critics. 	3
This movie really touched my heart, it really is the best movie of the year and everyone should see this masterpiece.	1

Poised to be an instant classic, almost everything about this film is phenomenal - the acting, the cinematography, the discography, etc.	4

It was well acted, directed, and the music was good. But the story is yawn. Not trying to rip anybody but I checked my watch a dozen times during this movie.	2

This movie is just plain bad. There must be some big payola going round this awards season. Badly written, average acting at best, all the characters are unrelatable and inlikeable. 2 hours of my life wasted.	2
I love this movie. This film is a milestone in cinematography. Great Immersive camera-work. This film is an experience and i has already seen it 4 times and I only see more quality of the film.	1
