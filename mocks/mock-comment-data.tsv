I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life	2022-11-07T21:00:00.000Z	5
This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.	2022-10-25T21:00:00.000Z	1
Poised to be an instant classic, almost everything about this film is phenomenal - the acting, the cinematography, the discography, etc.	2022-11-17T21:00:00.000Z	4
I personally found this movie to be boring. Definitely one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.	2022-12-08T21:00:00.000Z	4

It was well acted, directed, and the music was good. But the story is yawn. Not trying to rip anybody but I checked my watch a dozen times during this movie.	2022-09-04T21:00:00.000Z	3

The editing is a mess, and the transitions of the plot or characters are rather strange. There is no narrative focus and the storytelling is unbalanced. I cannot really understand why such a bad movie received an overwhelming approval from the critics. 	2022-11-23T21:00:00.000Z	2
This movie really touched my heart, it really is the best movie of the year and everyone should see this masterpiece.	2022-10-24T21:00:00.000Z	5

This movie is just plain bad. There must be some big payola going round this awards season. Badly written, average acting at best, all the characters are unrelatable and inlikeable. 2 hours of my life wasted.	2022-12-21T21:00:00.000Z	4

This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.	2022-12-12T21:00:00.000Z	1

I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life	2022-09-02T21:00:00.000Z	2
Poised to be an instant classic, almost everything about this film is phenomenal - the acting, the cinematography, the discography, etc.	2022-09-13T21:00:00.000Z	2

I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life	2022-10-17T21:00:00.000Z	2
It was well acted, directed, and the music was good. But the story is yawn. Not trying to rip anybody but I checked my watch a dozen times during this movie.	2022-10-30T21:00:00.000Z	3
This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.	2022-10-28T21:00:00.000Z	3
The editing is a mess, and the transitions of the plot or characters are rather strange. There is no narrative focus and the storytelling is unbalanced. I cannot really understand why such a bad movie received an overwhelming approval from the critics. 	2022-11-07T21:00:00.000Z	3
Poised to be an instant classic, almost everything about this film is phenomenal - the acting, the cinematography, the discography, etc.	2022-09-13T21:00:00.000Z	3
This movie is just plain bad. There must be some big payola going round this awards season. Badly written, average acting at best, all the characters are unrelatable and inlikeable. 2 hours of my life wasted.	2022-11-12T21:00:00.000Z	3
